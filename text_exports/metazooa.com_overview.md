The animal kingdom (Metazoa, in Greek) is full of our distant relatives... some more distant than others! Metazooa is a game that tests how well you know our extended family tree.

Your goal is to figure out today's Mystery Animal in as few guesses as possible. Wrong guesses will narrow down the answer by taxonomic rank (kingdom, phylum, class, order, etc.) The more your guess has in common with the answer, the more you will learn about the Animal.

For example, if the answer is “human”, your guesses might create a tree that looks like the following:

There is only one Mystery Animal per day, but you get 20 guesses to figure it out! A new game will start in 3h 41m.

Enter the zoo!
